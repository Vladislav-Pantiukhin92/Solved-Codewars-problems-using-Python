    "Our standard numbering system is (Base 10). That includes 0 through 9. Binary is (Base 2), only 1’s and 0’s. And Hexadecimal is (Base 16) (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F). A hexadecimal “F” has a (Base 10) value of 15. (Base 64) has 64 individual characters which translate in value in (Base 10) from between 0 to 63.\n",

    "In democracy we have a lot of elections. For example, we have to vote for a class representative in \n",
    "school, for a new parliament or a new government.\n",
    "Usually, we vote for a candidate, i.e. a set of eligible candidates is given. This is done by casting a \n",
    "ballot into a ballot-box. After that, it must be counted how many ballots (= votes) a candidate got.\n",

    "Your Task\n",

    "Task Description\n",
    "There are no given candidates. An elector can vote for anyone. Each ballot contains only one name and \n",
